Start

    Set up the variables

    Use a for loop to ask the user for 5 numbers add count by 1
        Ask the user to enter a number

        Add the input to total

        If the input is greater than max:
            Set min to input
        If the input is less than min:
            Set max to input

    Calculate average as total / 5
    Calculate interest as total * 0.20

    Print total, average, max, min, interest
